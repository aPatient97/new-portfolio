        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> I love programming and get a huge kick out of problem solving. I like how coding combines logical thinking and creativity into one beautiful science. </p>
        <p> I am a May 2022 graduate of <a href='https://www.getfutureproof.co.uk/' id='fp'target='_blank' rel="noreferrer">Futureproof</a>; a three month intensive coding bootcamp. </p>
        <p> I am proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node, Python, Flask & Django, SQL, MongoDB, Test Driven Development, Bootstrap, WordPress, command-line, GitHub and environment management.</p>
        <p> I especially enjoy JavaScript, CSS and making front-ends with React. It's amazing how far the languages have come and what you can do with pure CSS.</p>
        <p>Before coding, I worked as a chef in 11 kitchens across the UK and abroad. I have SEO and Wordpress experience from an internship at WNW Digital in Exeter. I code in my free time and I am looking for a job in the tech industry.</p>
        <p>At school I studied the sciences; earning 6A*s, 3As, 1B at GCSE and A, B, C in Biology, Chemistry and Physics at A level.</p>
        <p>I made this portfolio website using React, vanilla JavaScript and pure CSS. It's a one page project with conditionally rendered components.</p>
